# Snake B'n'B

This is a console application developed for the course [MongoDB and Python: Quick start](https://www.udemy.com/course/mongodb-and-python-quickstart-with-mongoengine/). It simulates a "cage sharing" application, where hosts can list their cages for snakes and guests can book a cage in a period of time.

To work with the data stored in MongoDB, it uses [MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org/#home), a Document-Object Mapper.
